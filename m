Could you please try this branch with CONFIG_SLUB_TINY=y?
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vbabka/linux.git/log/?h=slub-tiny-v1r0

Seeing your results I didn't modify default slub_max_order by this new
CONFIG (yet?) so maybe after trying the default, trying then also with
manual slub_max_order=0 and slub_max_order=1 would be useful too. Otherwise
it should be all changes to lower SLUB memory footprint. Hopefully it will
be visible in the number of free pages. But if fragmentation is an issue, it
might not be enough. BTW, during boot there should be a line "Built X
zonelists, mobility grouping ..." can you grep for it and provide please, I
wonder if mobility grouping ends up being off or on on that system.

Thanks!
