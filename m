Thanks!

Thanks for the testing! How much RAM does the system have btw? I found 8MB
somewhere, is that correct?
So 230 pages that's a ~920 kB difference. Last time we saw less  dramatic
difference [1]. But that was looking at Slab pages, not free pages. The
extra overhead could be also in percpu allocations, code etc.

In [1] it was possible to save some more memory with more tuning. Some of
that required boot parameters and other code changes. In another reply [2] I
considered adding something like SLUB_TINY to take care of all that, so
looks like it would make sense to proceed with that.
