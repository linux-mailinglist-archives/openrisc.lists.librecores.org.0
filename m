Test notes: I used Linus 6.1-rc5 as the base. That is the only thing I
changed in buildroot default config for the sipeed maix bit card, booting
with SD card. The test is: booting and run "cat /proc/vmstat" and register
the nr_free_pages value. I repeated the boot + cat 3 to 4 times for each case.

Here are the results:

6.1-rc5, SLOB:
    - 623 free pages
    - 629 free pages
    - 629 free pages
6.1-rc5, SLUB:
    - 448 free pages
    - 448 free pages
    - 429 free pages
6.1-rc5, SLUB + slub_max_order=0:
    - Init error, shell prompt but no shell command working
    - Init error, no shell prompt
    - 508 free pages
    - Init error, shell prompt but no shell command working
6.1-rc5, SLUB + patch:
    - Init error, shell prompt but no shell command working
    - 433 free pages
    - 448 free pages
    - 423 free pages
6.1-rc5, SLUB + slub_max_order=0 + patch:
    - Init error, no shell prompt
    - Init error, shell prompt, 499 free pages
    - Init error, shell prompt but no shell command working
    - Init error, no shell prompt

No changes for SLOB results, expected.

For default SLUB, I did get all clean boots this time and could run the
cat command. But I do see shell fork failures if I keep running commands.

For SLUB + slub_max_order=0, I only got one clean boot with 508 free
pages. Remaining runs failed to give a shell prompt or allow running cat
command. For the clean boot, I do see higher number of free pages.

SLUB with the patch was nearly identical to SLUB without the patch.

And SLUB+patch+slub_max_order=0 gave again a lot of errors/bad boot. I
could run the cat command only once, giving 499 free pages, so better than
regular SLUB. But it seems that the memory is more fragmented as
allocations fail more often.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you want to test something else.

Cheers.
