Hi Arnd,

As far as I can tell goldfish in qemu is not very old. There are 3 devices, 2 were
added for the m68k virt machine, and 1 for riscv virt.

The mips/loongson3_virt machine now also uses the goldfish_rtc.

The problem with the goldfish device models is that they were defined as
DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN.

    $ grep endianness hw/*/goldfish*
    hw/char/goldfish_tty.c:    .endianness = DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN,
    hw/intc/goldfish_pic.c:    .endianness = DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN,
    hw/rtc/goldfish_rtc.c:    .endianness = DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN,

RISC-V is little-endian so when it was added there was no problem with running
linux goldfish drivers.

MIPS Longson3, added last year, seems to be running as little-endian well, I
understand MIPS can support both big and little endian. However according to
this all Loongson cores are little-endian.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loongson

As I understand when endianness of the devices in qemu are defined as
DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN the device endian takes the endian of the target CPU.
This means that MIPS Loongson3 and RISC-V are affectively running as
little-endian which is what would be expected.

So it appears to me that in qemu that m68k is the only architecture that is
providing goldfish devices on a big-endian architecture.  Also, as far as I
know Linux is the only OS that was updated to cater for that.  If there are
other firmware/bootloaders that expect that maybe they could be updated too?
