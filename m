Yep, these are new for (upstream) QEMU, and AIUI the only OS we care
about for these is Linux, really. My understanding is that these devices
were added because they were conveniently available in Linux :-)
Where they do have a much older history is in the Android emulator,
but upstream QEMU doesn't care about that.

DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN means "whatever the 'native' endianness of the target
CPU architecture is". This is a compile-time thing, and doesn't change
if the CPU changes its endianness at runtime. So for instance for Arm
boards DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN and DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN are the same thing,
even if the guest OS is running with SCTLR_EL1.EE set (and even if a
particular board in qemu-system-arm sets up the CPU so it leaves reset
with .EE set to 1) The analogy on real hardware is that the way these
"switch endianness" CPUs work is that they just flip the bytes in the
data on their way out of the CPU, so changing the endianness in the CPU
doesn't cause devices to change the way they behave. QEMU's "target
endianness" is kind of like a property of the interconnect/system design
in some ways.

From QEMU's point of view, the thing we really don't want is devices
that magically change behaviour when the CPU switches endianness
at runtime, because those are weirdly unlike real hardware. (Virtio
is the main offender in this regard, but we're stuck with that.)
Devices that happen to be wired up differently on different target
architectures are fine for us. I don't have any definite examples
to hand, but my understanding is that this happens with real hardware
too, where a device (maybe 8250-compatible UART or Lance ethernet
are examples?) with 32-bit registers might be typically wired up in
a system for a big-endian CPU such that the guest code can write
a 32-bit word to it and get the "obvious" ordering matching the
device datasheet. This sort of thing is what DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN
was intended for. (There are also various places where we use it
where perhaps we should not where a device is exclusively used
on a CPU of a particular endianness, and so you could equally write
DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN or whatever without any behaviour change.)

So I don't have a strong view on whether these devices should
be DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN or DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN (except that
my impression is that a DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN device on a
big-endian system is a bit weird, because it means the guest
has to byteswap everything. You see that with PCI devices because
the PCI spec mandates LE, but not often elsewhere).

If there's an official-ish spec for how goldfish devices are
supposed to behave (does anybody have a pointer to one?) and it says
"always little-endian" then that would probably suggest that fixing
m68k would be nice if we can.
