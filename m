Indeed, I expected pushback on this :-)

I went for this due to how much simpler an int is to process/use compared
to a cpumask. There is the trigger example I listed above, but the
consumption of the trace event itself as well.

Consider this event collected on an arm64 QEMU instance (output from trace-cmd)

    <...>-234   [001]    37.251567: ipi_raise:            target_mask=00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000,00000004 (Function call interrupts)

That sort of formatting has been an issue downstream for things like LISA
[1] where events are aggregated into Pandas tables, and we need to play
silly games for performance reason because bitmasks aren't a native Python
type.

I had a look at libtraceevent to see how this data is exposed and if the
answer would be better tooling:

tep_get_field_val() just yields an unsigned long long of value 0x200018,
which AFAICT is just the [length, offset] thing associated with dynamic
arrays. Not really usable, and I don't see anything exported in the lib to
extract and use those values.

tep_get_field_raw() is better, it handles the dynamic array for us and
yields a pointer to the cpumask array at the tail of the record. With that
it's easy to get an output such as: cpumask[size=32]=[4,0,0,0,]. Still,
this isn't a native type for many programming languages.

In contrast, this is immediately readable and consumable by userspace tools

<...>-234   [001]    37.250882: ipi_send_cpu:         callsite=__smp_call_single_queue+0x5c target_cpu=2

Thinking out loud, it makes way more sense to record a cpumask in the
tracepoint, but perhaps we could have a postprocessing step to transform
those into N events each targeting a single CPU?

That's a good point, I wasn't sure about having a parameter serving as
discriminant for another, but the function address would be either valid or
NULL which is fine. So perhaps:
o callsite (i.e. _RET_IP_), serves as type
o address of callback tied to IPI, if any
o target CPUs

Sorry; I meant having several "specialized" tracepoints instead of a single one.
